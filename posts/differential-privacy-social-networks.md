I recently gave a presentation for the class CSC2419: Private Data Analysis, at
UofT. I presented a paper called Differentially Private Data Analysis of Social
Networks via Restricted Sensitivity, by Jeremiah Blocki, Avrim Blum, Anupam
Datta, and Or Sheffet [@blocki2013differentially].

[You can check out the slides here.](/files/differential-privacy-restricted-sensitivity/socialnetworks.pdf)
If I have time, I may write up a more detailed post to accompany these slides.
