  <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
</header>

<p>I'm a coffee nerd who loves learning, teaching, and making things, and who
also happens to be fascinated by theoretical and practical aspects of computer
science and math. My primary interests are in algorithm design, computational
complexity theory, and distributed computing. I'm also interested in functional
programming and software design. Right now I work as a Software Engineer at
<a href="https://www.sigmacomputing.com/">Sigma Computing</a> on the Query
Lifecycle team. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://www.rubrik.com/">Rubrik</a>,
on enterprise data management and cloud archival.

<p>I did my Bachelor's degree in <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/">Computer
Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>,
with a minor in <a href="http://www.math.utoronto.ca/">Mathematics</a>. During
my time there, I also did a couple of internships, where I worked on fraud
detection at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, and video search
at <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>.</p>
