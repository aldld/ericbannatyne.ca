<h2>Hello, World!</h2>

<p>I am a third-year undergraduate student at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">University
of Toronto</a> doing a specialist in <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/">computer science</a>
with a minor in <a href="http://www.math.utoronto.ca/">mathematics</a>. I spent the summer of
2015 working as a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>,
on the Risk Engineering team. I'm currently a software engineering intern at
<a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, where I work on the Search team.</p>

<p>I am fascinated by all areas of computer science and (most of) math; my primary interests
lie in artificial intelligence and theory of computation. My favourite branches of math are
topology, category theory, logic, and theory of computation.</p>

<p>Apart from studying and working on projects, I like to spend my spare time trying to get
closer to becoming halfway decent at playing chess and fencing.</p>

<h2>Courses</h2>

<p>I am currently completing courses towards a computer science specialist, with focuses
in artificial intelligence and theory of computation, and I have completed the requirements
for a minor in math.<!--For more information about the courses I have taken, am currently
taking, and plan on taking in the future, see my <a href="#">courses page</a>--></p>

<h3>Teaching</h3>

<p>I have four semesters of experience working as a TA, for the following courses in the UofT
Computer Science department:</p>
