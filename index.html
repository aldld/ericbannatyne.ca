<h2>Hello, World!</h2>

<p>I'm currently a Member of Technical Staff Intern at <a href="https://www.rubrik.com/">Rubrik</a>.
I spent the summer of 2016 working as a Software Engineering Intern at
<a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, on Video Search. Before that, I was a Software
Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, on the Risk Engineering team.
</p>

<p>I've completed a Bachelor of Science degree in <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/">Computer
Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>, with a minor in
<a href="http://www.math.utoronto.ca/">Mathematics</a>. I'll be returning to UofT in Fall 2017,
to join the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/">Theory of Computation Group</a> as a
Master's student. <a href="/courses">These are the courses that I've taken.</a></p>

<p>I'm fascinated by all areas of computer science. My primary interests are in algorithm design,
computational complexity theory, and distributed computing. I'm also interested in functional
programming, and machine learning. Some of my hobbies include fencing, and brewing coffee.</p>
