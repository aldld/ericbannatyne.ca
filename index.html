<h2>Hello, World!</h2>

<p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">University
of Toronto</a> doing a specialist in <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/">computer science</a>
with a minor in <a href="http://www.math.utoronto.ca/">mathematics</a>. I spent the summer of
2015 working as a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>,
on the Risk Engineering team. During the summer of 2016 I was a Software Engineering Intern at
<a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, where I worked on Video Search.</p>

<p>I am fascinated by all areas of computer science and (most of) math; my primary interests
lie in algorithm design, theory of computation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. My favourite
branches of math are topology, category theory, logic, and theory of computation.</p>

<p>Apart from studying and working on projects, I like to spend my spare time trying to get
closer to becoming halfway decent at playing chess and fencing.</p>

<h2>Courses</h2>

<p>I am currently completing courses towards a computer science specialist, and
I have completed the requirements for a minor in math. For a complete list of
